Welcome to the official documentation of the Knowledge Repository project.

The Knowledge Repository is a set of tools that manage a curated collection of “Knowledge Posts” along with a web interface to view and disseminate them. Knowledge Posts are a shared abstraction for all sorts of technical and non-technical documents such as Jupyter and R Markdown notebooks, Markdown documents, Google Documents, presentations, and so on. It was created at Airbnb to solve the problem of scaling technical knowledge dissemination within a growing team of data scientists, as sharing progress via one-off emails, documents, slideshows and git repositories was becoming increasingly impractical. It has since grown to be an indispensable part of the way we share knowledge not just between data scientists, but also with the rest of the company. We invite you to join us in deploying and using the Knowledge Repository in your workplace.

Check out this `Medium Post`_ for more background on the inspiration for the project.

**Note:** The Knowledge Repository is a work in progress. Your assistance and involvement is more than encouraged.

Feedback for Beta
-----------------

The Knowledge Repo is currently in a public beta, and we are rolling it out to more people to get feedback. In particular, we'd love to hear about the following:

 - How easy is it to set up the git knowledge post repository?
 - How easy is it to set up the web application, and make it live internally within your organization?
 - Where are the gaps in our documentation that we should fill in to assist others in understanding the system?
 - At a higher level, are there any blockers or barriers to setting up the Knowledge Repo in your organization?
