        # Blinker
        
        Blinker provides a fast dispatching system that allows any number of
        interested parties to subscribe to events, or "signals".
        
        Signal receivers can subscribe to specific senders or receive signals
        sent by any sender.
        
            >>> from blinker import signal
            >>> started = signal('round-started')
            >>> def each(round):
            ...     print "Round %s!" % round
            ...
            >>> started.connect(each)
            
            >>> def round_two(round):
            ...     print "This is round two."
            ...
            >>> started.connect(round_two, sender=2)
          
            >>> for round in range(1, 4):
            ...     started.send(round)
            ...
            Round 1!
            Round 2!
            This is round two.
            Round 3!

        ## Requirements
        
        Blinker requires Python 2.4 or higher, Python 3.0 or higher, or Jython 2.5 or higher.
        
        ## Changelog Summary
        
        1.3 (July 3, 2013)
        
         - The global signal stash behind blinker.signal() is now backed by a
           regular name-to-Signal dictionary. Previously, weak references were
           held in the mapping and ephemeral usage in code like
           ``signal('foo').connect(...)`` could have surprising program behavior
           depending on import order of modules.
         - blinker.Namespace is now built on a regular dict. Use
           blinker.WeakNamespace for the older, weak-referencing behavior.
         - Signal.connect('text-sender') uses an alternate hashing strategy to
           avoid sharp edges in text identity.
        
        1.2 (October 26, 2011)
        
         - Added Signal.receiver_connected and Signal.receiver_disconnected
           per-Signal signals.
         - Deprecated the global 'receiver_connected' signal.
         - Verified Python 3.2 support (no changes needed!)
        
        1.1 (July 21, 2010)
        
         - Added ``@signal.connect_via(sender)`` decorator
         - Added ``signal.connected_to`` shorthand name for the
           ``temporarily_connected_to`` context manager.
        
        1.0 (March 28, 2010)
        
         - Python 3.x compatibility
        
        0.9 (February 26, 2010)
        
         - Sphinx docs, project website
         - Added ``with a_signal.temporarily_connected_to(receiver): ...`` support
