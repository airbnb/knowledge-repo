Assignment for the post at Elucidata, New Delhi

#Purpose

Tracking the analysis
A very important part of a analysis is its reproducibility. To make analysis reproducible we need
to preserve threads of thoughts and share it. One way to do this is to use a framework which
preserves all the steps in an analysis and what else can be better than git. Fortunately, we
already have solutions such as ​ knowledge repo​ available.
Task: Use knowledge repo to track the analysis done above and host it on GitHub (don’t make
the data public)
