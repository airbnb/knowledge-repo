# Authentication configuration
# ---------------------------------------------------
# Authentication providers allow users to sign into the Knowledge Repo
# in a variety of different ways. You can create your own subclass of
# `KnowledgeAuthProvider` and add either the instance or identifier
# used for that class below.
# By default, the knowledge repo offers:
# ['debug', 'oauth2', 'bitbucket', 'github', 'google']
AUTH_PROVIDERS = []

# If you are going to use a OAuth provider, you will need to specify client ids
# and private tokens. This can be done by instantiating instances of
# `OAuth2Provider` and adding them to the above list, or by specifying OAuth
# connection properties as demonstrated below for the GitHub authenticator.
# OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = '<client id>'
# OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET = '<client secret>'

# To configure a generic OAuth provider that is not one of the presets
# provided, you may use the provider 'oauth2' which creates an empty,
# unconfigured OAuth2Provider. You must then override its configuration.
# For example, for a self-managed Gitlab CE instance at gitlab.example.com:

# OAUTH_OAUTH2_BASE_URL = 'https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_AUTHORIZATION_URL = 'https://gitlab.example.com/oauth/authorize'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL = 'https://gitlab.example.com/oauth/token'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_AUTO_REFRESH_URL = 'https://gitlab.example.com/oauth/token'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_SCOPES = 'api'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_USER_INFO_ENDPOINT = 'user'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_USER_INFO_MAPPING = {
#     'identifier': 'username',
#     'name': 'name',
#     'avatar_uri': 'avatar_url'
# }
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_VERIFY_SSL_CERTS = '/path/to/certs/my.ca-bundle'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID = '<client id>'
# OAUTH_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET = '<client secret>'

# The configuration OAUTH_<name>_VERIFY_SSL_CERTS is what is passed to the
# 'verify' parameter in the Requests module, and can be used to disable
# HTTPS verification (not recommended) or provide a custom CA bundle. See:
# http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification

# You may also override the .validate() method of a KnowledgeAuthProvider
# to perform an additional validation step before authenticating a user.
# The following example checks whether a user has access to the git remote
# of the local Knowledge Repository:

# def OAUTH_OAUTH2_VALIDATE(provider, user):
#
#     if provider.app.repository.git_has_remote:

# which opens a vector for malicious users to compromise
# the server. If you want to avoid this risk, pass
# the '--safe' (TODO!) option to `knowledge_repo` config and
# manually configure the repository here.

# index will be updated on the main thread before every request that is more
# than `INDEX_INTERVAL` seconds after the last sync completed. Otherwise,
# indexing will occur every `INDEX_INTERVAL` seconds after the previous sync.
# Syncing is designed to be compatible with multiple instances of the Knowledge
# Repo connected to the same database, accross multiple machines and/or
# processes; and so a global indexing lock is employed. When a sync begins,
# a sync lock is put in place and the responsible process is considered to be
# the primary agent responsible for syncing until its last update is longer than
# `INDEXING_TIMEOUT` seconds, whereby the lock is ceded to the next requesting
# process. Note that `INDEXING_TIMEOUT` must be larger than `INDEXING_INTERVAL`
# or strange things might begin to happen.

# context of multiple Knowledge Repo servers working together to serve the
# repositories across multiple machines, which each require repository syncing.
